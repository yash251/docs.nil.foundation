# User account utilities

This page describes the scripts managing user credentials and account, `signup.py` and `auth_tools.py`.

## Creating a new account

### Usage

To see all parameters that can be passed to the script, run it with the `-h` option:

```console
$ python3 signup.py -h

usage: signup.py [-h] -u USER -p PASSWD -e EMAIL

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USER, --user USER  user name
  -p PASSWD, --passwd PASSWD
                        password
  -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL
                        email
```

### Example

```bash
python3 signup.py -u helloworld -p password123 -e hello@test.com
```

### Possible results

Success:

```json
{
  "user": "helloworld",
  "active": true,
  "extra": {},
  "error": false,
  "code": 201
}
```

If the signup is successful, this command creates `.user` and `.secret` files with your credentials in the `./scripts` directory.

Error #1 — invalid username format:

```bash
Error: 400 {"code":409,"error":true,"errorMessage":"Invalid format for username"}
```

The username does not support special characters and can only be a combination of letters and numbers.

Error #2 — duplicate user:

```bash
Error: 500 {"error":true,"errorNum":1702,"errorMessage":"duplicate user","code":500}
```

## Signing in

If you already have an account, store your username and password in files `.user` and `.secret` in the `./scripts` folder:

```console
$ echo '<username>' > .user
$ echo '<password>' > .secret
```

And that's it; the authorization will be performed automatically when you run any of the toolchain's scripts.

The authorization file (JWT authorization token) will be stored in `./scripts/auth.json`.
